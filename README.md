The main aim of the model was to predict the age and gender for the given image.

So nearly 3000 images were taken intially for the training purposes.Each gender consists of equal number of images.Then the same images were classified as according to the age 
group.Since there are only few images for the female above 60 years they were duplicated using the image data generator.Now the dataset is available for the training.Now all the images are converted into the array and each and every images are converted into the same pixel.Which could help the nueral network training.
Convolution Neural Network has been build.The model was trained with the help of available datasets and proceeded further.
